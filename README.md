# Piscine_Swift
42's formation about Swift and iOS

# Objective
Discover how native iOS app are created with XCode and Swift4.

# Project's constraints
Each day for 2 weeks we had to create a new app in 24 hours. Each new app pushed us to learn new Swift and iOS principles, and this knowledge was needed for all the following days.
During the weekend we were teamed up with another random student and we had 48 hours to do a bigger app (called rush00 and rush01).

# Project Overview
Here is a short description of what each app waas required to do:
- D00: Create a calculator app
- D01: OOP principles in Swift
- D02: How TableView, Custom Cell and Segue work
- D03: How to load data from the net using background threads
- D04: Retrieve the last 100 Tweets from the Twitter API based on a given keyword or hastag
- Rush00: Create an app that can fetch the Forum infos from the 42 internal API after having logged in, add replies and delete own messages
- D05: Basic app about MapKit and User Location
- D06: Basic app about UIDynamicAnimator and UIBehaviours such as gravity, collisions and elasticity
- D07: Learn how to use Pods by creating an app that get a place location with the RecastAI pod and find it's weather with the ForecastIO pos
- D08: Creation of our own Pod, it should use CoreData to save custom infos
- D09: Use the Pod created in D08 to create a Personal Diary app, also implement Local Authentication
- Rush01: Improve the MapKit application of D05 by giving the possibility to seach for a place and have directions to go there, either having as a starting point the user location or another place

# How to launch
Each day is in a separate folder, in each of them you will find the .xcodeproj/.xcworkspace that can be opened with XCode and then you will just need to build the app.
