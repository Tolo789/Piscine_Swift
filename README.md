# Piscine_Swift
42's formation about Swift and iOS

# Objective
Discover how native iOS app are created with XCode and Swift4.

# Project's constraints
Each day for 2 weeks we had to create a new app in 24 hours. Each new app pushed us to learn new Swift and iOS principles, and this knowledge was needed for all the following days.
During the weekend we were teamed up with another random student and we had 48 hours to do a bigger app (called rush00 and rush01).

# How to launch
Each day is in a separate folder, in each of them you will find the .xcodeproj/.xcworkspace that can be opened with XCode and then you will just need to build the app.
